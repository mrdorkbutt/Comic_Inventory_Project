index.php was my first effort at extracting mySQL with PHP. I am using some code that is deprecated. That needs to be fixed. All and all successful though.  I pulled data from two fields from a table called series.

index_table.php was my taking the initial mysql results and putting them into a table format. I still have not solved my deprecated code issue.  Jimmy is going to take one of these and hand me back a non-deprecated version.
